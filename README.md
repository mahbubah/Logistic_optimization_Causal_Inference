# Logistic optimization: Delivery drivers location optimization with Causal Inference

Gokada is the largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria. Its works are partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria.

The inefficient positioning of pilots (Gokada refers to its motor drivers as pilots) and customers who wish to utilize Gokada to ship their parcel is one of the major problems the company has encountered (as it grows its business). This has caused many delivery orders to be unmet.

We will work on Gokada’s data to understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers locations that increase the fraction of complete orders. Since drivers are paid based on the number of requests they accept, the solution (we’ll eventually propose) will help Gokada business grow both in terms of client satisfaction and increased business.
